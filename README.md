Trafiłem do zakładu psychiatrycznego dla wysoko rozwiniętych humanoidów, aby wydobyć z tamtejszych 'pensjonariuszy' potrzebne mi informacje. Ostatni raz z uzyskaniem odpowiedzi na pytania miałem taki problem, gdy mój jedyny świadek odnalazł się w prosektorium, ale i tym razem nie jest łatwo. 
 Moi świadkowie to humanoidalne roboty, które na skutek przeżytej traumy trafiły do tego zakładu. Ich systemy są bardzo niestabilne, a odpowiedzi nieprzewidywalne. To jednak jedyne istoty, które mogą mi pomóc rozwiązać zagadkę. Potrzebuję Twojej pomocy.
